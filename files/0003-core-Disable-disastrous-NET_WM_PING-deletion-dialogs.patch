Subject: [PATCH 3/3] core: Disable disastrous NET_WM_PING deletion dialogs

These cause more hassle than they're worth, and break many SDL games.
These apps are just slower to start (Thunderbird) or GL-locked (SDL),
and throwing up a "not responsive" window to break focus, input, etc,
when it clearly *is* working, just isn't helpful to anyone.

It should also be noted that many of these apps do not *voluntarily*
subscribe to NET_WM_PING, so to destroy them for not responding to an
advertised capability is a major regression.
